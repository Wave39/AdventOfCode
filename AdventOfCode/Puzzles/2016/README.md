| [5](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/5) | :fire: | 3m 5s | This still runs too long, but by using a routine that encodes the bytes from the MD5 function into a hex string, I was able to cut the time down from over 17 minutes to about 3 minutes. For now, this will have look like a win. |

| [12](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/12) | :warning: | 21s | By pre-processing the instructions instead of parsing them over and over again, I was able to get this one down to about 20 seconds from about 7 minutes. |

| [14](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/14) | :fire: | 4m 59s | The changes that I made for day 5 of this year also helped bring this down from 26 minutes to about 5 minutes. |
