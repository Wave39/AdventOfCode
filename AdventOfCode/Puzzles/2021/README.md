| [7](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7) | :smile: | <1s | This one would have taken 2 or 3 seconds to solve, so I decided to try to cache the fuel consumption values for part 2, and it worked out great. |

| [12](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12) | :smile: | 8s | Day 12 is the furthest that I have made it so far with my own solutions finishing in less than a second, so this one is a bit disappointing. I will have to circle back eventually and figure out how to accomplish this one faster. |
| [13](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13) | :smile: | 1s |
| [14](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/14) | :smile: | 1s | As usual, part 2's processing becomes unwieldy quickly when doing the brute force processing that works so well on part 1. An assist goes out to Gereon Steffens for providing the key that I could follow. |
| [15](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15) | :warning: | 31s | My Dijkstra routine worked great on part 1 but took way too long on part 2, so I found some code that Luke Redpath put together that modified the algorithm a little to prioritize the points, and that seems to have brought the time down to a manageable amount. |

| Status | Time for solution | Next steps |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| :smile: | 0..<10 seconds | All good here! |
| :eyes: | 10..<20 seconds | Could use some tidying up... |
| :warning: | 20..<60 seconds | Investigation is warranted. |
| :fire: | 60... seconds | Could be raining... |
