## The Text Adventure
Day 25 consists of a Zork-like text adventure game.
I set up my first attempt to take input from the terminal, so I could manually map out the world generated by the input data.
Then, once I did that, I put together the sequence of moves to collect all of the items that can be collected (watch out for the lava!) and drop them in
the room right outside the security checkpoint.
Then I could go through all combinations of those 8 items until one sequence worked.

This was a very fun puzzle to close out the Advent of Code for 2019. Bravo to Eric Wastl and his team for another great December.
## Hall of Shame
### Day 16
I had to borrow an algorithm from another person who solved this problem and adapt it to Swift to get part 2 finished.
### Day 18
White flag raised.
### Day 22
See Day 16.
### Day 23
I was able to get both parts solved with my code, but with a huge assist to another person's Swift solution.
