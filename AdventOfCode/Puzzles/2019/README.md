## The Text Adventure
Day 25 consists of a Zork-like text adventure game.
I set up my first attempt to take input from the terminal, so I could manually map out the world generated by the input data.
Then, once I did that, I put together the sequence of moves to collect all of the items that can be collected (watch out for the lava!) and drop them in
the room right outside the security checkpoint.
Then I could go through all combinations of those 8 items until one sequence worked.

This was a very fun puzzle to close out the Advent of Code for 2019. Bravo to Eric Wastl and his team for another great December.
