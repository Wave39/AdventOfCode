| 23 | :smile: | <1s | Trying to run part 2 brute force is designed to not work by the devious Advent Of Code people. I figured that the code input needed to be optimized, but was too lazy to do so myself. As a result, the solution to part 2 is stolen from another participant. Please see the comments in the code for the URL. |
