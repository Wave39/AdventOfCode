I must say that as of right now, Sunday January 5, 2020, I don't really remember back far enough to the 2018 Advent of Code.
However, it must have been a rough time, as there are quite a few Hall of Shame entries.
I guess my excuse can be that I was recovering from a major heel surgery and was not feeling quite like myself.

## Status

| 15 | :smile: | <1s | For part 1, I had to give up because my solution was taking too long. |
| 16 | :smile: | <1s |
| 17 | :smile: | <1s | My part 1 solution was getting very close to working, but kept breaking down when I tried to make changes. |
| 18 | :eyes: | 17s |
| 19 | :smile: | 5s | 
| 20 | :smile: | <1s |
| 21 | :smile: | <1s | Both part of my solution work, but part 2 takes over 3000 seconds (50 minutes) to chug through to a solution. This is why I do not have a test case for part 2. |
| 22 | :smile: | <1s | Part 2 was too complicated, so I ended up borrowing someone else's solution. |
| 23 | :smile: | <1s | See Day 22. |
| 24 | :smile: | <1s | See Day 17. |

| :smile: | 0..<10 seconds | All good here! |
| :eyes: | 10..<20 seconds | Could use some tidying up... |
| :warning: | 20..<60 seconds | Investigation is warranted. |
| :fire: | 60... seconds | Never mind, just get me a glass of hot fat. |
