I must say that as of right now, Sunday January 5, 2020, I don't really remember back far enough to the 2018 Advent of Code.
However, it must have been a rough time, as there are quite a few Hall of Shame entries.
I guess my excuse can be that I was recovering from a major heel surgery and was not feeling quite like myself.

| [15](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/15) | :smile: | <1s | For part 1, I had to give up because my solution was taking too long. |
| [16](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/16) | :smile: | <1s |
| [17](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/17) | :smile: | <1s | My part 1 solution was getting very close to working, but kept breaking down when I tried to make changes. |

| [21](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/21) | :smile: | <1s | Both part of my solution work, but part 2 takes over 3000 seconds (50 minutes) to chug through to a solution. This is why I do not have a test case for part 2. |
| [22](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/22) | :smile: | <1s | Part 2 was too complicated, so I ended up borrowing someone else's solution. |
