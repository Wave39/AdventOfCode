## Hall of Shame
At a certain point of looking at a problem and banging one's head against a wall, you just have to give up and let someone smarter than you carry the mail.
Here are some of those situations.
### Day 15
For part 1, I had to give up because my solution was taking too long.
### Day 17
My part 1 solution was getting very close to working, but kept breaking down when I tried to make changes.
### Day 21
Both part of my solution work, but part 2 takes over 3000 seconds (50 minutes) to chug through to a solution. 
This is why I do not have a test case for part 2.
### Day 22
Part 2 was too complicated, so I ended up borrowing someone else's solution.
### Day 23
See Day 22.
