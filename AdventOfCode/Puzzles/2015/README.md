| [20](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/20) | :eyes: | 16s | The original solution that I had for this day was wildly inefficient, and when I tried to get it working here in Swift 5, I let it run for like 8 hours and it still did not finish day 1. As a result, I decided to seek a better solution, which I found on the internet. The algorithm I found has been implemented here and credit for the URL given at the top of the code. |

### Legend

| Status | Time for solution | Next steps |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| :smile: | 0..<10 seconds | All good here! |
| :eyes: | 10..<20 seconds | Could use some tidying up... |
| :warning: | 20..<60 seconds | Investigation is warranted. |
| :fire: | 60... seconds | It was a bad call, Ripley. |
