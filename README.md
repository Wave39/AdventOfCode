# Advent Of Code Solution Machine

This Mac OS command line application provides solutions to the puzzles on the Advent Of Code web site. 
You will need to be running version 11.0 or newer of Xcode with Swift 5.0 in order to use this project.

I have chosen to try and tackle these exercises in Swift mostly as a way to continue to learn and get more proficient with Swift.

When you run these command line tool applications, make sure to show the Debug area (Command-Shift-Y) 
to enter in which day of the challenge you want to solve, and to see the print output from the Swift code.

Also, keep in mind that the tests all have the puzzle input and solutions for my user ID.
If you change the puzzle input for your own puzzle input, the tests will most likely fail to work.

## Yearly recaps

Here are some links to the README files for the various years, along with my thoughts about the solutions.
